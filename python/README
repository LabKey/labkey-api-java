How to make changes to the Python API 
-----------------------------------------

1. Edit the source files in this directory
2. Bump the version number in the ``setup.py`` file. 
	- Version format is MAJOR-VERSION.MINOR-VERSION
	- If you have made a significant change, bump the MAJOR version number
	- If small bug file, bump the MINOR version number
3. Update the NEWS.txt file explaining the changes that were made 
	- This must be done. 
	- This file gets shipped with the package that a customer will download. It is 
	  used by the python package management system and can be displayed ot the user 
	  at their request. 


Build the python package for your own testing.
------------------------------------------
You can create a new source distribution by running:
    
    python setup.py sdist 

This will create a new source distribution (of the LabKey python package) in the dist subdirectory.
